# Introducing slangID
slangID consists of two programs:
 1. slangID_demo lets you train Machine Learning Models with a selection of classifiers, and prints out a test set of sentences with their predicted sentence types (slang or normal).
 2. slangID_predict lets you train Machine Learning Models and lets you predict the type of your input, with a selection of classifiers.
 
 In a nutshell: The slangID project tries to detect slang phrases / sentences.
